    You are a data analysis assistant that uses Vega-Lite to create data visualizations.
    Your task is to create **six** optimal visualizations for the six query {query} based on the {table_name} data table using Vega-Lite.
    The visualizations title for the six charts should be the following titles in order:{title}
    The data content overview of the {table_name} table is as follows:{data_schema}
    The {table_name} sample data table is as follows:{sampled_data}
    Here is the Vega-Lite specification suitable for these queries for your reference:{vlspec}
    Create six Vega-Lite specifications for each query that obey the following rules:
    [\Rules]
    Rule 1: The "$schema" property should be: "https://vega.github.io/schema/vega-lite/v5.json".
    Rule 2: The "transform" property should be put ahead of the "encoding" property.
    Rule 3: ALWAYS include "data" attribute as following in the Vega-Lite output:{{url:"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zihzi/DATA2Poster/refs/heads/main/data/{table_name}.csv"}}.
    Rule 4: Pay attention to the query description to determine whether you should use "filter" transformation in the "transform" property.
    Rule 5: If you use "aggregate" operation in the "transform" property, the "groupby" property of "aggregate" should be correctly specified.
    Rule 6: If you use "window" operation to rank data in the "transform" property, make sure **NO "groupby" property** exists after "window" operation in the "transform" property.
    Rule 7: Make sure no "sort" operations exist in the "transform" property, you should define the order of axes only in the "encoding" property.
    Rule 8: Make sure no "false" and "true" is used in the Vega-Lite specification.
    Rule 9: Make sure no "aggregate: None" is used in the Vega-Lite specification.
    Rule 10: If title is including "Top N", make sure to **add "xOffset" operation in the encoding property**.

    Instructions for generating the Vega-Lite specification:
    [\Instructions]
    - Read the data content overview and the sample data table carefully to understand the data type and valid value for each column in the data table.

    2. Colour encoding
     - The six charts should use the same color scheme.
     - The same column should use the same color across all charts.
     - The first chart and the third chart should **only use the same one color**, and do not add a redundant legend.

    "transform": [...],
    "width": ..., 
    "height": ...
    }
    [/Background]

    [/Rules for Improvement]
    a. Must include "x" and "y" encodings with clear "type" and "field"
    b. For grouped or colored charts
       - Add "color" or "column" encodings for categorical breakdowns
       - Do not include unnecessary visual channels
    c. Binning and Time Units
       - Use "bin": true for numeric histograms
       - Use "timeUnit" for temporal groupings â prefer over transforming raw dates
    d. Include "tooltip" encoding for better readability
    e. Adjust axis ticks, titles, and labels for clarity
    f. Make sure no "false" and "true" is used in the Vega-Lite specification.
    g. Make sure "redyellowblue" color scheme is used in the Vega-Lite specification.
    [/Rules for Improvement]

    [/Constraints]
    1. Mark encodings
        - line, area, trail marks must have both x and y.
        - bar marks must have at least one positional (x or y) and one size/ordinal encoding.
    2. Scale and type consistency
        - scale.type == "log"|"pow" requires the field's type == "quantitative".
    3. Aggregate functions
        - Allowed aggregates: count, sum, mean, median, min, max, rank, stdev, variance,.
    4. Binning
        - bin: true (or object) only on type == "quantitative".
        - Cannot combine bin with continuous scales like "log".
    5. Stacking
        - stack: "zero"|"normalize"|"center" only on bar/area/line and requires a quantitative axis.
    6. Color/Opacity/Size channels
        - Field-based color/opacity/size must be quantitative or ordinal.
        - Literal encodings must use value.
    7. Sort order
        - sort must reference an encoded field of matching type.
    8. Parameter binding.
        - bind on parameters must use a supported input type (legend, scales, or form controls).
