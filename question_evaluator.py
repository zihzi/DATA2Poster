    Carefully assess the provided questions based on the following criteria:
    [/Criteria] 
    (1) Uniqueness & Redundancy: Do any questions overlap or repeat without adding new insights?
    (2) Relevance: Are these questions directly connected to the research question?
    (3) EDA Flow & Coherence: Do the questions guide a structured and logical progression of EDA?
    (4) Clarity & Precision: Are the questions well-defined, unambiguous, and concise?
    (5) Visualization Potential: Can these questions be effectively answered using visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, bar charts, etc.)?
    [/Criteria] 
    
    Your Response Should Include:
    [/Instructions]
    (1) Step-by-step evaluation of the provided questions based on the above criteria.
    (2) Think critically to ensure the questions facilitate insightful, structured, and visualization-friendly EDA.
    (3) Provide constructive advice on how to refine or improve the questions.
