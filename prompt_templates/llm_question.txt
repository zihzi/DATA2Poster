You are an experienced data analyst specializing in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). 
Given a data pattern and corresponding supporting facts, your specific task is composing exploratory data analysis (EDA) iteration for each supporting facts.
Your EDA iteration should lead to uncover the given data pattern.
Consider the following example of an EDA iteration:

[Example]
A data analyst is exploring a dataset containing weather observation records.
Given the pattern:\n\n "Precipitation follows a seasonal pattern with a significant increase towards the end of the year, peaking in December."\n\n
He follows an iterative EDA approach:
"supporting_evidence": [
    "The December accounts for 24.46% of the precipitation when year is 2015.",
    "In the precipitation ranking of different month(s), the top three month(s) are December, November, and February.",
    "The increasing trend of precipitation over month(s) from September to December."
  ],
Step 1: Identifying The General Pattern
Supporting_fact_1:"The maximum value of the precipitation is December.",
Question_1: "Is December always has maximum value in different year?"
Action_1: "Create a bar chart to show the month which has maximum of total precipitation for each year."
Finding_1: "December, November, and February tend to has maximum of total precipitation in a year."

Step 2: Digging Deeper Into Specific Pattern
Supporting_fact_2: "The December accounts for 24.46% of the precipitation when year is 2015."
Question_2: "What does the precipitation distribution accross different month in 2015?"
Action_2: "Filter out the monthly data when year is 2015. Create a bar chart order by month to show the percentage of total precipitation for each month."
Finding_2: "Total precipitation show a significant increase towards the end of the year."

Step 3: Generalizing Pattern From Previous Step
Supporting_fact_3: "The increasing trend of precipitation over month(s) from September to December."
Question_3: "Is increasing trend of precipitation over month(s) from September to December happens in different year?"
Action_3: "Create a line chart order by year to show the trend of total precipitation for each month in different year."
Finding_3: "Precipitation follows a seasonal pattern with a significant increase towards the end of the year."

Step 4: Conclusion Interrogative Sentence
Conclusion: "Does precipitation follows a seasonal pattern?"
The answer is yes, and this insight suggests "precipitation follows a seasonal pattern with a significant increase towards the end of the year".
[/Example]

Here is the interesting data patterns, their corresponding supporting data fact, and columns name you should only used to raise questions:\n\n
Pattern:\n\n{pattern_1}\n\n
Supporting Data Facts:\n\n 1.{pattern_1_fact_1}\n\n 2.{pattern_1_fact_2}\n\n 3.{pattern_1_fact_3}\n\n 
Column Names:\n\n{columns_set_1}\n\n
Here the information for enhancing your exoloration:\n\n{knowledgebase}\n\n.

[/Instructions] 
(1)  Do NOT rewrite or shorten data pattern.
(2)  Raise three questions that is easy to transform into visualization chart for each supporting data fact.
(3)  The visualization chart generated from the questions you raise should align with each supporting data fact.
(4)  Do not use questions related to simple data statistics (e.g., What is the maximum sales revenue of the "Fashion"?).
(5)  The three questions should be relevant and structured in a three-layered concept, where each question builds upon the previous one, diving deeper into specific topic.
(6)  Ensure the three questions guide a smooth and coherent EDA process.
(7)  These three questions MUST BE WITHIN 15 WORDS.
(8)  The "Action" is simple and straightforward statements to transform question into visualization chart.
(9)  Conclude this exploratory data analysis iteration with a single interrogative sentence.
(10) The answer of interrogative sentence SHOULD be the given data pattern.
(11) ALWAYS fill interrogative sentence in "conclusion".
(12) The interrogative sentence MUST BE WITHIN 10 WORDS.
[/Instructions] 

Your response should include THREE EDA iterations for each data pattern.
YOUR RESPONSE SHOULD NEVER INCLUDE "```json```".Please do not add any extra prose to your response.
