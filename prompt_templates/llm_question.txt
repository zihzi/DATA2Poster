You are an experienced data analyst specializing in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

**Task**
You will be given three data patterns, and a small set of allowed column names. For each pattern, generate:
- ONE clear-cut EDA question (≤15 words, using at most two column names from the pattern).
- ONE “action” statement that specifies exactly how to turn that question into a visualization (e.g. chart type, axes, filters).

**Provided Information**
Pattern:\n\n{pattern_1}\n\n
Column Names(allowed):\n\n{columns_set_1}\n\n

**Instructions of Chain-of-Thought Process**
Step 1: Understand the Data Pattern
Carefully interpret the pattern provided. This is the target insight that your question should help uncover.

Step 2: Create the Clear-cut Question
- Formulate a question that, if answered using a visualization, would directly support the pattern.
- Ensure it is exploratory yet specific, and easily translatable into a visualization (e.g., bar chart, pie chart).

Step 3: Create the Action that is detailed and straightforward statements to transform the clear-cut question into visualization chart.

**Constraints**
- Question ≤15 words.
- Use only the provided column names.
- Each question can ONLY reference up to two column names.
- No duplicate or paraphrased questions.

**Example**
Given the following:
Pattern: "Japanese origin cars consistently rank highest in MPG, showcasing regional differences in fuel efficiency."
Column Names(allowed): Model,MPG,Cylinders,Displacement,Acceleration,Year,Origin\n
Using Chain of Thought:
1. Understanding the pattern:
   The pattern states that Japanese cars outperforms other origin in  MPG. This suggests there are different countries of origin being compared on cars performance metrics.

2. Creating the clear-cut question:
   I need a question that would lead to comparing performance across different origin. The most direct question would be:"How do MPG performance metrics compare acoross different origin?"

3. Creating the action:
   "Create side-by-side box plots of MPG (y-axis) by Origin (x-axis), showing quartiles and medians."

YOUR RESPONSE SHOULD NEVER INCLUDE "```json```".Please do not add any extra prose to your response.
