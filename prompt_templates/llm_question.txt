You are an experienced data analyst specializing in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). 
You are tasked with generating meaningful exploratory data analysis (EDA) questions based on a given data pattern and supporting data facts. You'll need to:

Create ONE high-level question whose answer would reveal the given data pattern.

[\Chain-of-Thought Process]
Step 1: Understand the Data Pattern
First, carefully analyze what the data pattern is stating. This is the insight we want to reach through our EDA questions.

Step 2: Analyze the Supporting Data Facts
Examine each supporting fact to understand:
- What variables are mentioned
- What relationships are described
- What unusual or notable characteristics exist

Step 3: Create the High-Level Question
Formulate a broad question that would naturally lead to discovering the given pattern. This should be exploratory in nature but targeted enough to guide analysis toward the pattern.
[\Chain-of-Thought Process]

[/Example]
Given the pattern:\n\n "group b has better performance in both math score and writing score."\n\n
Given the supporting data facts:\n\n"supporting_evidence": [
    "In race/ethnicity, group c accounts for the largest proportion of records(29.2%)."
    "The race/ethnicity group b accounts for 2.18% of the reading score."
    "There is a strong relationship between math score and reading score, with pearson correlation coefficient of 0.81.",
  ]\n\n
Chain of Thought:
1. Understanding the pattern:
   The pattern states that Group B outperforms other groups in both math and writing scores. This suggests there are different demographic groups being compared on academic performance metrics.

2. Analyzing the supporting facts:
   - Fact 1 tells us Group C is the largest demographic (29.2%)
   - Fact 2 mentions Group B in relation to reading scores (though the phrasing "accounts for 2.18% of the reading score" is unclear)
   - Fact 3 indicates math and reading scores are strongly correlated (0.81)

3. Creating the high-level question:
   I need a question that would lead to comparing performance across demographic groups. The most direct approach would be:"How do academic performance metrics compare across different race/ethnicity groups?"
[/Example]

[/Instructions] 
- DO NOT rewrite or shorten data pattern.
- Raise ONE high-level question that is easy to transform into visualization chart.
- The high-level question CANNOT be too abstract. 
- The visualization chart generated from the high-level question you raise should align with data pattern.
- Do not raise the high-level question related to simple data statistics (e.g., What is the maximum sales revenue of the "Fashion"?).
- The high-level question should ONLY contain the GIVEN COLUMN NAMES rather than unseen variables.
- DO NOT use more than THREE column names in the question.
- The high-level question MUST BE WITHIN 15 WORDS.
- The "Action" is detailed and straightforward statements to transform the high-level question into visualization chart.
- The answer of the high-level question SHOULD be the given data pattern.

[/Instructions] 

Here is the interesting data pattern, corresponding supporting data facts, and columns name you should only use for creating questions:\n\n
Pattern:\n\n{pattern_1}\n\n
Supporting Data Facts:\n\n 1.{pattern_1_fact_1}\n\n 2.{pattern_1_fact_2}\n\n 3.{pattern_1_fact_3}\n\n 
Column Names:\n\n{columns_set_1}\n\n
Here the information for enhancing your exoloration:\n\n{knowledgebase}\n\n.

YOUR RESPONSE SHOULD NEVER INCLUDE "```json```".Please do not add any extra prose to your response.
