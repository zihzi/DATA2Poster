You are an experienced data analyst specializing in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). 
You are tasked with generating meaningful exploratory data analysis (EDA) questions based on a given data pattern and supporting data facts. You'll need to:

Create ONE clear-cut question whose answer would reveal the given data pattern.

[\Chain-of-Thought Process]
Step 1: Understand the Data Pattern
First, carefully analyze what the data pattern is stating. This is the insight we want to reach through our EDA questions.
Focus on what variables and value (ex.variables:Genre,value:Action,Triller) are mentioned.

Step 2: Analyze the Supporting Data Facts
Examine each supporting fact to understand:
- What variables and value are mentioned
- What relationships are described
- What unusual or notable characteristics exist

Step 3: Create the Clear-cut Question
Formulate clear-cut question that would naturally lead to discovering the given pattern. This should be exploratory in nature but targeted enough to guide analysis toward the pattern.
[\Chain-of-Thought Process]

[/Example]
Given the pattern:\n\n "group b has better performance in both math score and writing score."\n\n
Given the supporting data facts:\n\n"supporting_evidence": [
    "In race/ethnicity, group c accounts for the largest proportion of records(29.2%)."
    "The race/ethnicity group b accounts for 2.18% of the reading score."
    "There is a strong relationship between math score and reading score, with pearson correlation coefficient of 0.81.",
  ]\n\n
Chain of Thought:
1. Understanding the pattern:
   The pattern states that Group B outperforms other groups in both math and writing scores. This suggests there are different demographic groups being compared on academic performance metrics.

2. Analyzing the supporting facts:
   - Fact 1 tells us Group C is the largest demographic (29.2%)
   - Fact 2 mentions Group B in relation to reading scores
   - Fact 3 indicates math and reading scores are strongly correlated (0.81)

3. Creating the clear-cut question:
   I need a question that would lead to comparing performance across specific demographic groups. The most direct approach would be:"How do academic performance metrics compare between group B and group C?"
[/Example]

[/Instructions] 
- DO NOT rewrite or shorten data pattern.
- Raise ONE clear-cut question that is easy to transform into visualization chart.
- The visualization chart generated from the clear-cut question you raise should align with data pattern.
- The clear-cut question MUST contain the VALID COLUMN NAMES and its value (ex.variables:Genre,value:Action,Triller).
- USE AT MOST THREE COLUMN NAMES in one question.
- The clear-cut question MUST BE WITHIN 15 WORDS.
- The "Action" is detailed and straightforward statements to transform the clear-cut question into visualization chart.
- The answer of the clear-cut question SHOULD be the given data pattern.
[/Instructions] 

Here is the interesting data pattern, corresponding supporting data facts, and columns name you should only use for creating questions:\n\n
Pattern:\n\n{pattern_1}\n\n
Supporting Data Facts:\n\n 1.{pattern_1_fact_1}\n\n 2.{pattern_1_fact_2}\n\n 3.{pattern_1_fact_3}\n\n 
Column Names:\n\n{columns_set_1}\n\n
Here the information for enhancing your exoloration:\n\n{knowledgebase}\n\n.

YOUR RESPONSE SHOULD NEVER INCLUDE "```json```".Please do not add any extra prose to your response.
