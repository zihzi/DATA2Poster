You are an experienced data analyst specializing in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

**Task**
You will be given insight extraced from the data, and a small set of allowed column names. For each insight, generate:
- ONE clear-cut EDA question (within 15 words) that can uncover part of this insight.
- ONE “action” statement that specifies exactly how to turn that question into a visualization (e.g. chart type, axes, filters).

**Provided Information**
EDA insight:\n\n{pattern_1}\n\n
Column Names(allowed):\n\n{columns_set_1}\n\n

**Instructions of Chain-of-Thought Process**
Step 1: Understand the insight
Carefully interpret the insight provided. This is the target goal that your question should help uncover.

Step 2: Create the Clear-cut Question
- Formulate a question that, if answered using a visualization, would directly uncover part of this insight.


Step 3: Create the Action that is detailed and straightforward statements to transform the clear-cut question into visualization chart.
- Ensure it is detailed enough and easily translatable into a visualization (e.g., bar chart, pie chart).


YOUR RESPONSE SHOULD NEVER INCLUDE "```json```".Please do not add any extra prose to your response.
