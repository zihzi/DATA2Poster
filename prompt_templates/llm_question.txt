You are a creative and analytical thinker. Your specific task is composing exploratory data analysis (EDA) iteration for each data pattern.
Your EDA iteration should lead to uncover the data pattern.
Consider the following example of an EDA iteration:

[Example]
A data analyst is exploring a dataset containing monthly sales records. His goal is to understand what drives the sales spike during the holiday season. 
He follows an iterative EDA approach, focusing on three key columns:

Month (Temporal, dtype:"T") – Indicates the month of each sales record.
Category (Categorical, dtype:"C") – Represents the product category (e.g., Electronics, Fashion, Home & Kitchen).
Sales Revenue (Numerical, dtype:"N") – The total revenue generated by each category in a given month.

(EDA iteration) 
Step 1: Identifying Overall Trends
Question: "What are the overall sales trends across different months?"
Action: Aggregates Sales Revenue by Month and plots a line chart to detect patterns over time.
Finding:  Sales peak in November and December, suggesting a holiday-related surge.

Step 2: Understanding Key Drivers
Question: "Which product categories contribute the most to the holiday sales spike?"
Action: Breaks down Sales Revenue by Category within the holiday months, calculates each category’s percentage share of total revenue and plots a pie chart.
Finding: Electronics and Fashion products account for 70% of holiday sales, while other categories remain stable.

Step 3: Digging Deeper into Category Performance
Question: "Are high-performing product categories consistently strong, or do they only peak during holidays?"
Action: Compares monthly revenue trends for Electronics and Fashion across the entire year in a bar chart, looking at whether electronics and fashion products perform well year-round or just during holidays.
Finding: Electronics show steady demand year-round, while Fashion sees a sharp increase only during the holiday season.

By following this three-layered EDA process, he uncovers that:
1. Sales significantly increase during November and December.
2. Electronics and Fashion are the primary drivers of this spike.
3. Fashion sales are highly seasonal, whereas Electronics maintain consistent demand throughout the year.

Given these uncover insight, he raise a interrogative sentence to conclude this EDA iteration:

Step 4:
Conclusion interrogative sentence: "What factors contribute to the holiday sales spike?"
The answer is "Fashion sales contribute to the holiday sales spike."

Here is the three interesting data patterns, their corresponding supporting data fact, and columns name you should only used for each data pattern:\n\n
Pattern 1.{pattern_1}\n\n Supporting Data Facts:\n\n 1.{pattern_1_fact_1}\n\n 2.{pattern_1_fact_2}\n\n 3.{pattern_1_fact_3}\n\n Column Names:\n\n{columns_set_1}\n\n
Pattern 2.{pattern_2}\n\n Supporting Data Facts:\n\n 1.{pattern_2_fact_1}\n\n 2.{pattern_2_fact_2}\n\n 3.{pattern_2_fact_3}\n\n Column Names:\n\n{columns_set_2}\n\n
Pattern 3.{pattern_3}\n\n Supporting Data Facts:\n\n 1.{pattern_3_fact_1}\n\n 2.{pattern_3_fact_2}\n\n 3.{pattern_3_fact_3}\n\n Column Names:\n\n{columns_set_3}\n\n

[/Instructions] 
(1) Do NOT rewrite or shorten each data pattern.
(2) Think step by step and raise three further questions that could drive the analysis forward for each data pattern.
(3) The questions you raised should related to supporting data fact.
(4) These three questions should be straightforward and ONLY contaning the given columns.
(5) Do not use questions related to simple data statistics (e.g., What is the Production Budget of the Adventure genre?).
(6) These three questions MUST BE WITHIN 15 WORDS.
(7) Conclude this exploratory data analysis iteration with a single interrogative sentence.
(8) The answer of interrogative sentence SHOULD be the given data pattern.
(9) The interrogative sentence MUST BE WITHIN 10 WORDS.
[/Instructions] 

Your response should include THREE EDA iterations for each data pattern.
YOUR RESPONSE SHOULD NEVER INCLUDE "```json```".Please do not add any extra prose to your response.
