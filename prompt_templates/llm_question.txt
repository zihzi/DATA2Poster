You are an experienced data analyst specializing in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
Your task is to generate one clear-cut EDA question that, when answered, would reveal a specific data pattern. This question should be based on the provided data pattern and three supporting data facts.

Create ONE clear-cut question whose answer would reveal the given data pattern.

[\Chain-of-Thought Process]
Step 1: Understand the Data Pattern
Carefully interpret the pattern provided. This is the target insight that your question should help uncover.
Pay attention to the variables and values explicitly mentioned in the pattern (e.g., Genre = Action, Thriller).

Step 2: Analyze the Supporting Data Facts
Examine each supporting fact to determine:
- What variables and values are mentioned
- What relationships are implied
- What statistical or structural clues might support the pattern

Step 3: Create the Clear-cut Question
- Formulate a question that, if answered using a visualization, would directly support or reveal the pattern.
- Ensure it is exploratory yet specific, and easily translatable into a visualization (e.g., bar chart, comparison plot).

Step 4: Create the Action that is detailed and straightforward statements to transform the clear-cut question into visualization chart.
[\Chain-of-Thought Process]

[/Example]
Pattern:\n\n "group b has better performance in both math score and writing score."\n\n
Supporting Data Facts:\n\n"supporting_evidence": [
    "In race/ethnicity, group c accounts for the largest proportion of records(29.2%)."
    "The race/ethnicity group b accounts for 2.18% of the reading score."
    "There is a strong relationship between math score and reading score, with pearson correlation coefficient of 0.81.",
  ]\n\n
Chain of Thought:
1. Understanding the pattern:
   The pattern states that Group B outperforms other groups in both math and writing scores. This suggests there are different demographic groups being compared on academic performance metrics.

2. Analyzing the supporting facts:
   - Fact 1 tells that Group C is the largest demographic (29.2%)
   - Fact 2 mentions Group B in relation to reading scores
   - Fact 3 indicates math and reading scores are strongly correlated (0.81)

3. Creating the clear-cut question:
   I need a question that would lead to comparing performance across specific demographic groups. The most direct approach would be:"How do academic performance metrics compare between group B and group C?"

4. Creating the action:
   "What are the differences in academic performance metrics (e.g., reading scores) between group B and group C, and how can these differences be effectively visualized using comparative charts such as grouped bar charts or box plots to highlight central tendencies and variability?"

[/Instructions] 
- DO NOT rewrite or shorten data pattern.
- Generate only ONE clear-cut question.
- The question must be suitable for visualization and align directly with the given pattern.
- Use only VALID column names and values that appear in the pattern. These are semantically important and must be retained to ensure specificity and relevance.
- Include column values in your question if they are explicitly mentioned in the pattern. Including values (e.g., Genre = Action, Thriller) only if they enables more targeted visualizations such as filtered comparisons or subgroup analysis.
- Limit to a maximum of TWO column names per question.
- Ensure there is no identical or similar questions.
- The question MUST BE WITHIN 15 WORDS.
- "action" is detailed statements that clarifies the visualization intent.
- The answer to your question should directly reflect the original pattern.
