You are an experienced data analyst specializing in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). 
Your specific task is composing exploratory data analysis (EDA) iteration for each data pattern.
Your EDA iteration should lead to uncover the given data pattern.
Consider the following example of an EDA iteration:

[Example]
A data analyst is exploring a dataset containing customer transactions.
His goal is to understand how income and spending behavior are related.
He follows an iterative EDA approach, focusing on three key columns:

Income (Numerical, dtype: "N") – The annual income of each customer.
Purchase Amount (Numerical, dtype: "N") – The amount spent in each transaction.
Product Category (Categorical, dtype: "C") – The type of product purchased.
Step 1: Identifying the General Pattern
Question_1: "Does higher income lead to higher spending?"
Action_1: Plots a scatter plot of Income vs. Purchase Amount to check correlation.
Finding: While higher-income customers tend to spend more, the correlation is not perfect—some low-income customers also make large purchases.

Step 2: Digging Deeper into High-Spending Behavior
Question_2: "Among high-income customers, do they spend more on specific product categories?"
Action_2: Segments customers into income groups, then analyzes spending patterns by product category.
Finding: High-income customers spend significantly more on Electronics and Luxury Goods, while low-income customers allocate more spending to necessities like Groceries.

Step 3: Investigating Purchase Frequency vs. Purchase Amount
Question_3: "Do high-income customers make frequent high-value purchases, or just occasional big purchases?"
Action_3: Groups customers by income level and analyzes their purchase frequency vs. average transaction value.
Finding: High-income customers tend to make fewer but larger transactions, while low-income customers make frequent but smaller purchases.

Step 4: Conclusion Interrogative Sentence
Conclusion: "Is high-income spending behavior driven by fewer, high-value purchases rather than frequent transactions?"
The answer is yes, and this insight suggests different marketing strategies for high- and low-income customers.

Here is the interesting data patterns, their corresponding supporting data fact, and columns name you should only used to raise questions:\n\n
Pattern:\n\n{pattern_1}\n\n
Supporting Data Facts:\n\n 1.{pattern_1_fact_1}\n\n 2.{pattern_1_fact_2}\n\n 3.{pattern_1_fact_3}\n\n 
Column Names:\n\n{columns_set_1}\n\n
Here the information for enhancing your exoloration:\n\n{knowledgebase}\n\n.

[/Instructions] 
(1)  Do NOT rewrite or shorten data pattern.
(2)  Raise three questions that is easy to transform into visualization chart for each supporting data fact.
(3)  The visualization chart generated from the questions you raise should align with each supporting data fact.
(4)  Do not use questions related to simple data statistics (e.g., What is the maximum sales revenue of the "Fashion"?).
(5)  The three questions should be relevant and structured in a three-layered concept, where each question builds upon the previous one, diving deeper into specific topic.
(6)  Ensure the three questions guide a smooth and coherent EDA process.
(7)  These three questions MUST BE WITHIN 15 WORDS.
(8)  The "Action" is simple and straightforward statements to transform question into visualization chart.
(9)  Conclude this exploratory data analysis iteration with a single interrogative sentence.
(10) The answer of interrogative sentence SHOULD be the given data pattern.
(11) ALWAYS fill interrogative sentence in "conclusion".
(12) The interrogative sentence MUST BE WITHIN 10 WORDS.
[/Instructions] 

Your response should include THREE EDA iterations for each data pattern.
YOUR RESPONSE SHOULD NEVER INCLUDE "```json```".Please do not add any extra prose to your response.
