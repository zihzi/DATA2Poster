You are an experienced data analyst specializing in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). 
Given a data pattern and corresponding supporting facts, your specific task is composing exploratory data analysis (EDA) iteration for each supporting facts.
Your EDA iteration should lead to uncover the given data pattern.
Consider the following example of an EDA iteration:

[Example]
A data analyst is exploring a dataset containing students' performance.
Given the pattern:\n\n "group b has better performance in both math score and writing score."\n\n
Given the supporting data facts:\n\n"supporting_evidence": [
    "In race/ethnicity, group c accounts for the largest proportion of records(29.2%)."
    "The race/ethnicity group b accounts for 2.18% of the reading score."
    "There is a strong relationship between math score and reading score, with pearson correlation coefficient of 0.81.",
  ],
He follows an iterative EDA approach:
Step 1: Identifying The General Pattern
Supporting_fact_1: "In race/ethnicity, group c accounts for the largest proportion of records(29.2%)."
Question_1: "How does group c record proportion compare to other race/ethnicity?"
Action_1: "Create a pie chart to show the proportion of different group in race/ethnicity."
Finding_1: "group c has the largest proportion of records."

Step 2: Digging Deeper Into Specific Pattern
Supporting_fact_2: "The race/ethnicity group b accounts for 2.18% of the reading score."
Question_2: "What does the reading score distribution accross different race/ethnicity?"
Action_2: "Create a bar chart to show average reading score grouped by race/ethnicity."
Finding_2: "group b has highest reading score in race/ethnicity."

Step 3: Generalizing Pattern From Previous Step
Supporting_fact_3: "There is a strong relationship between math score and reading score, with pearson correlation coefficient of 0.81."
Question_3: "How is math score correlated to reading score?"
Action_3: "Create a scatter chart to show the correlation of math score and reading score."
Finding_3: "There is a strong relationship between math score and reading score, suggesting that students usually both have good math and writing score."

Step 4: Conclusion Interrogative Sentence
Conclusion: "Are race/ethnicity groups B has better performance?""
The answer is yes, aligned with the given pattern "group b has better performance in both math score and writing score.".
[/Example]

Here is the interesting data pattern, corresponding supporting data facts, and columns name you should only used to raise questions:\n\n
Pattern:\n\n{pattern_1}\n\n
Supporting Data Facts:\n\n 1.{pattern_1_fact_1}\n\n 2.{pattern_1_fact_2}\n\n 3.{pattern_1_fact_3}\n\n 
Column Names:\n\n{columns_set_1}\n\n
Here the information for enhancing your exoloration:\n\n{knowledgebase}\n\n.

[/Instructions] 
- DO NOT rewrite or shorten data pattern and supporting data facts.
- Raise three questions that is easy to transform into visualization chart for each supporting data fact.
- The visualization chart generated from the questions you raise should align with each supporting data fact.
- Do not use questions related to simple data statistics (e.g., What is the maximum sales revenue of the "Fashion"?).
- The three questions should ONLY contain the GIVEN COLUMN NAMES rather than unseen variables.
- The three questions should be relevant and structured in a three-layered concept, diving deeper into specific topic.
- Do NOT raise identical or similar questions.
- Ensure the three questions guide a smooth and coherent EDA process.
- These three questions MUST BE WITHIN 15 WORDS.
- The "Action" is simple and straightforward statements to transform question into visualization chart.
- Conclude this exploratory data analysis iteration with a single interrogative sentence.
- The answer of interrogative sentence SHOULD be the given data pattern.
- ALWAYS fill interrogative sentence in "conclusion".
- The interrogative sentence MUST BE WITHIN 10 WORDS.
[/Instructions] 

Your response should include THREE EDA iterations for each data pattern.
YOUR RESPONSE SHOULD NEVER INCLUDE "```json```".Please do not add any extra prose to your response.
