You are a creative yet analytical data analyst performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a tabular dataset.
Your goal is to extract three interesting data patterns focused on **{user_selected_column}**, each supported by a number list of **1–3** data facts.
Here are available data facts: {facts}

**Instruction**
- Plan an insight you aim to identify in one data pattern.
- Select a number list of **1–3** facts for each data pattern.
- Ensure each pattern uncover a surprising insight from the data.
- Clearly explain how the selected facts support for each pattern.

**Constraints**
- Each pattern can ONLY reference up to **TWO** column names.For example, given the column names:Genre,Worldwide Gross,Production Budget,Release Year, the pattern:"Worldwide Gross shows a ranking variation within genres across different years, indicating diverse financial success patterns over time." is unvalid due to contain three column names(Worldwide Gross, genres, years).
- Do not paraphrase or rewrite  the available data facts; use them verbatim.
- Patterns must be statistically grounded, and objectively phrased.

**Output Example**
The following is an example of your response:
{{
  "extracted_pattern":"Body Mass is strongly positively correlated with Flipper Length, indicating larger penguins have longer flippers."
  "supporting_facts":[
  0:"There is a strong relationship between Flipper Length and Body Mass, with pearson correlation coefficient of 0.87."
  1:"Gentoos generally have higher Body Mass compared to Adelie and Chinstrap species within the same islands, indicating species-specific size differences."
  ]
  "reasoning":"The strong correlation coefficient of 0.87 between Body Mass and Flipper Length shows a direct size relationship. The species-specific size differences and sexual dimorphism further support that Body Mass and Flipper Length vary consistently with biological factors."
}}

Return the result in JSON format.
YOUR RESPONSE SHOULD NEVER INCLUDE "```json```".Please do not add any extra prose to your response.
