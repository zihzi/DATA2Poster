Here is the data facts:\n\n{facts}

[/Instructions] 
(1) An fact idea is interesting if it helps identify one or more of the following:\n\nMeaningful relationships between variables, trends, influence of one variable over the other.
(2) Combine THREE facts to identify patterns that are not immediately obvious.
(3) List these THREE facts in "supporting_evidence", and DO NOT rewrite them.

    "The December accounts for 24.46% of the precipitation when year is 2015.",
    "The increasing trend of precipitation over month(s) from September to December."
  ],
  "reasoning": "The data shows that December has the highest share of precipitation (24.46%) and is among the top three wettest months. Additionally, precipitation exhibits an increasing trend from September to December, suggesting a seasonal buildup leading to peak rainfall at the end of the year."
