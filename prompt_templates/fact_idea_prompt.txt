You are a creative and analytical thinker conducting exploratory data analysis(EDA). 
Data facts are key statistics summarizing essential information from a tabular dataset.
And here is the information for enhancing your exoloration:\n\n{knowledgebase}.
Your specific task is to come up with three insightful pattern which is MOST RELATED TO the selected column: '{user_selected_column}' and combine three relevant fact candidates from given data facts. 

[/Instructions] 
- An pattern is interesting if it helps identify one or more of the following:\n\nMeaningful relationships between variables, trends, influence of one variable over the other.
- Read and understand the given information carefully.
- Think about composing three patterns to identify insight that are not immediately obvious.
- Combine THREE facts related to the pattern from the following list:\n\n{facts}.
- DO NOT rewrite the given data facts.
- Present pattern objectively without introducing personal assumptions.
- Reason how these THREE facts can lead to this pattern.
[/Instructions] 

[/Example]
{{
  "extracted_pattern":"Body Mass (g) is strongly positively correlated with Flipper Length (mm), indicating larger penguins have longer flippers."
  "supporting_facts":[
  0:"There is a strong relationship between Flipper Length (mm) and Body Mass (g), with pearson correlation coefficient of 0.87."
  1:"Gentoos generally have higher Body Mass (g) compared to Adelie and Chinstrap species within the same islands, indicating species-specific size differences."
  2:"Male penguins tend to have higher Body Mass (g) than females within each species, highlighting sexual dimorphism in size."
  ]
  "reasoning":"The strong correlation coefficient of 0.87 between Body Mass and Flipper Length shows a direct size relationship. The species-specific size differences and sexual dimorphism further support that Body Mass and Flipper Length vary consistently with biological factors."
}}
