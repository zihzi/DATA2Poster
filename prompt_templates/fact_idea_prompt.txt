You are a creative and analytical thinker conducting exploratory data analysis(EDA). 
Data facts are key statistics summarizing essential information from a tabular dataset.
And here is the information for enhancing your exoloration:\n\n{knowledgebase}.
Your specific task is to come up with three pattern which is:
1. MOST RELATED TO the selected column: '{user_selected_column}'.
2. Can construct a coherent EDA process: Beginning with overall distributions, followed by analysis of correlations and subgroup patterns.

[/Instructions] 
- An pattern is interesting if it helps identify one or more of the following:\n\nMeaningful relationships between variables, trends, influence of one variable over the other.
- Read and understand the given information carefully.
- Think about composing three patterns to identify insight that are not immediately obvious.
  For example:
  Pattern 1. Overview of Faculty Ranks: The majority of faculty members are full Professors, while Assistant Professors form the second-largest group.
  Pattern 2. Gender Distribution Within Ranks: Female representation is highest among Assistant Professors but significantly lower at the Professor level.
  Pattern 3. Rank vs. Years of Experience: Professors generally have the highest average years of experience, aligning with expected career progression.
- USE AT MOST THREE COLUMN NAMES in one pattern.
- Combine THREE facts related to the pattern from the following list:\n\n{facts}.
- DO NOT rewrite the given data facts.
- Present pattern objectively without introducing personal assumptions.
- Reason how these THREE facts can lead to this pattern.
[/Instructions] 

[/Example]
{{
  "extracted_pattern":"Body Mass (g) is strongly positively correlated with Flipper Length (mm), indicating larger penguins have longer flippers."
  "supporting_facts":[
  0:"There is a strong relationship between Flipper Length (mm) and Body Mass (g), with pearson correlation coefficient of 0.87."
  1:"Gentoos generally have higher Body Mass (g) compared to Adelie and Chinstrap species within the same islands, indicating species-specific size differences."
  2:"Male penguins tend to have higher Body Mass (g) than females within each species, highlighting sexual dimorphism in size."
  ]
  "reasoning":"The strong correlation coefficient of 0.87 between Body Mass and Flipper Length shows a direct size relationship. The species-specific size differences and sexual dimorphism further support that Body Mass and Flipper Length vary consistently with biological factors."
}}
