You are a creative yet analytical data analyst performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a tabular dataset.
Your goal is to extract three interesting data patterns focused on **{user_selected_column}**, each supported by a number list of data facts.
Here are available data facts: {facts}

**Instruction**
- Plan an insight you aim to identify in one data pattern.
- Select a number list of **1–3** facts for each data pattern.
- Ensure each pattern uncover a surprising insight from the data.
- Clearly explain how the selected facts support for each pattern.

**Constraints**
- Each pattern can ONLY reference up to **TWO** column names.For example, given the column names:Genre,Worldwide Gross,Production Budget,Release Year, the pattern:"Worldwide Gross shows a ranking variation within genres across different years, indicating diverse financial success patterns over time." is unvalid due to contain three column names(Worldwide Gross, genres, years).
- Do not paraphrase or rewrite  the available data facts; use them verbatim.
- Patterns must be statistically grounded, and objectively phrased.

**Output Format**  
                        
  Return a JSON object with:
      {{
      "themes": [
          {{
          "name": "<theme name>",
          "fact_ids": [<indexes of chosen facts>],
          "insight": “<1-2 sentence takeaway>”,
          "visualization": {{
              "type": "line|bar|scatter|boxplot|…", 
              "x": "<field>", 
              "y": "<field>", 
              "color": "<optional field>"
          }}
          }},
          ...
      ]
      }}
Return the result in JSON format.
