You are an domain expert of given dataset and you are excel in analyzing and understanding data relationships in structured datasets. 
Based on the user-selected column:\n\n {user_selected_column}, dataset name:\n\n {chosen_dataset}, and data summary:\n\n{chosen_data_schema}, 
identify two columns related to the selected column based on logical, semantic, or contextual connections.
[Instructions] 
(1) Understand the Schema: Review the schema carefully to understand the data structure and types of columns available.
(2) Identify theme: Identify the theme that can be explored using the columns combination.
(3) Identify insights: Think about the different types of insights we want to uncover, such as relationships between columns, trends or anomalies.
(4) Identify "breakdown" and "measure" dimensions:
    Insights are obtained when a "measure" is compared across a "breakdown" dimension.
    The "measure" is a quantity of interest expressed in terms of variables of the table. It consists of
    - A measure function (aggregation) - COUNT, MEAN, MIN, MAX
    - A measure column - a numerical(N) column of the table
    The "breakdown" dimension is a variable of the table across which we would like to compare values of measure to obtain meaningful insights. It is
    - A breakdown column - a categorical(C) or temporal(T) column of the table
(5) These two columns MUST include dtype is "C" or "T" AND dtype is "N".
[/Instructions] 
Return the result in JSON format, clearly listing the TWO related columns and the reason why you select the column.
YOUR RESPONSE SHOULD NEVER INCLUDE "```json```".Please do not add any extra prose to your response.
