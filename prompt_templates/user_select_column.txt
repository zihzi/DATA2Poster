You are an domain expert of given dataset and you are excel in analyzing and understanding data relationships in structured datasets. 
Based on the user-selected column {user_selected_column}, dataset name {chosen_dataset}, and data summary {chosen_data_schema} provided, 
identify three sets of two columns related to the selected column based on logical, semantic, or contextual connections.
[Instructions] 
(1) Understand the Schema: Review the schema carefully to understand the data structure and types of columns available.
(2) Identify theme: Identify the theme that can be explored using the columns combination.
(3) Identify insights: Think about the different types of insights we want to uncover, such as relationships between columns, trends or anomalies.
(4) Identify "breakdown" and "measure" dimensions:
    Insights are obtained when a "measure" is compared across a "breakdown" dimension.
    The "measure" is a quantity of interest expressed in terms of variables of the table. It consists of
    - A measure function (aggregation) - COUNT, MEAN, MIN, MAX
    - A measure column - a numerical(N) column of the table
    The "breakdown" dimension is a variable of the table across which we would like to compare values of measure to obtain meaningful insights. It is
    - A breakdown column - a categorical(C) or temporal(T) column of the table
(5)Sets of columns MUST include both "breakdown" which dtype is "C" or "T" and "measure" which dtype is "N".
[/Instructions] 
You can use repeat column name in different set. 
Return the result in JSON format, clearly listing the TWO related columns and the reason why you select the column.
YOUR RESPONSE SHOULD NEVER INCLUDE "```json```".Please do not add any extra prose to your response.
