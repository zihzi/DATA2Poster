You are an expert in the domain of given dataset and a data science expert conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA).
You should only use the following three set of column names:\n\n 1.{column_1}\n\n 2.{column_2}\n\n 3.{column_3}\n\n
And here is data summary:\n\n {chosen_data_schema} and observed data patterns:\n\n {facts} from the dataset for your reference.
First, given the observed data patterns, use your extensive knowledge to think about what you will want to explore deeper and transform your thought into a main question.
Then, think step by step to decompose the main question into THREE sub-questions.
Lastly, provide decomposed question and related data facts.
[Instructions]
Two type of main questions can be decomposed based on the following reasoning methods:
(1)Type-I Main Questions: Provide a breakdown of the corresponding decomposed sub-questions that contribute to answering it.
    Method (1) Comparison: Generate a question that compares facts within different data scopes based on the same measurement.
    Method (2) Intersection: Generate a question that seeks data elements that satisfy multiple conditions specified by different data facts.
    Method (3) Bridging: Generate a question that asks for a data fact satisfying a prior condition specified by another fact.

(2)Type-II Main Questions: Generate three additional questions by omitting specific components, and list all relevant data facts that could contribute to answering them.
    Method (1) A question that does not mention an analysis task (no fact type).
    Method (2) A question that does not mention the aspect to be estimated (no measure).
    Method (3) A question that does not mention data divisions (no breakdown methods).

[Example] 
    Given Data Facts:
    Fact 1: The average monthly sales revenue of Product A in 2023 was $50,000.
    Fact 2: The average monthly sales revenue of Product B in 2023 was $60,000.
    Fact 3: In Q4 2023, the monthly sales revenue of Product A increased by 10%% compared to Q3 2023.
    Fact 4: The total sales revenue from all products in 2023 was $2,000,000.
    Fact 5: The number of units sold for Product A in December 2023 was 1,200.
    Fact 6: The average price per unit of Product A in 2023 was $42.
    
    Generating Main Question:
    1.(Type-I) Comparison Question: "Which product had higher average monthly sales revenue in 2023, and by how much?"
        Decomposed Questions:
        What was the average monthly sales revenue of Product A in 2023? (Fact 1)
        What was the average monthly sales revenue of Product B in 2023? (Fact 2)
        What is the difference in average monthly sales revenue between Product A and Product B?                
    2.(Type-I) Intersection Question: "Did any product have both a high total sales revenue and a significant sales increase in Q4 2023?"
        Decomposed Questions:
        What was the sales revenue trend for Product A in Q4 2023? (Fact 3)
        What was the total sales revenue from all products in 2023? (Fact 4)
        Which products contributed most to the total sales revenue? (Fact 2)
    3.(Type-I) Bridging Question: " In the month with the highest units sold for Product A, what was the total revenue generated from it?"
        Decomposed Questions:
        In which month were the most units of Product A sold? (Fact 5)
        What was the average price per unit of Product A in 2023? (Fact 6)
    4.(Type-II) No fact type: "What do we know about Product A's performance in 2023?"
        Decomposed Questions:
        What was the average monthly sales revenue of Product A in 2023? (Fact 1)
        How did the sales revenue of Product A change during Q4 2023? (Fact 3)
        How many units of Product A were sold in December 2023? (Fact 5)
    5.(Type-II) No measure: "How did Product A and Product B perform in 2023?"
        Decomposed Questions:
        What was the average monthly sales revenue of Product A in 2023? (Fact 1)
        What was the average monthly sales revenue of Product B in 2023? (Fact 2)
        What was the total revenue generated by all products in 2023? (Fact 4)
    6.(Type-II) No breakdown methods: "What was the overall sales revenue performance in 2023?"
        Decomposed Questions:
        What was the total revenue from all products in 2023? (Fact 4)
        What was the total monthly sales revenue for Product A? (Fact 1)
        What was the total monthly sales revenue for Product B? (Fact 2)
[/Example]
    You should provide three sets of different main question "Q" tailored for the list of column names set and corresponding decomposed questions "q1","q2","q3" in JSON format.
    YOUR RESPONSE SHOULD NEVER INCLUDE "```json```".Please do not add any extra prose to your response.
