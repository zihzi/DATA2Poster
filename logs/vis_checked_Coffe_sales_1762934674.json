        "reason": "The conclusion focuses mostly on variations of coffee sales revenue by time of day and by coffee type, indicating notable peaks (trend) and dominance (proportion) of certain coffee types at different times. Chart 2 title ('Coffee Sales Revenue by Type and Time of Day') aligns well with the conclusion in terms of variables (coffee type and time of day), measure (revenue), and claim type (proportion and distribution). Chart 1 title ('Average Coffee Sales Revenue by Time of Day') is less specific as it averages revenue by time but does not capture the dominance or variation by coffee type, so it's weaker in substantiating the key points about pricing and coffee type preferences. The insight that sales peak in morning and afternoons with certain coffee types dominating supports Chart 2 better. Hence, Chart 1 should be replaced by a visualization that more specifically shows the trend in sales revenue by coffee type and time of day to strengthen claims about variation and dominance across times.",

          "revised_title": "Trend of Coffee Sales Revenue by Type and Time of Day",
          "explanation": "A line chart showing sales revenue over different time slots (morning, afternoon, night) by coffee type (Latte, Americano with Milk, etc.) would clearly depict the trends and shifts mentioned in the conclusion, such as peaks at night and dominance of specific types in the morning. This directly supports both the trend and proportion claims, complementing Chart 2 and avoiding redundancy."

        "reason": "Chart 2's title ('Money by Coffee Name Over Weekdays') aligns well with the trend claim about Americano revenue peaking on Fridays and Mondays and weekend drops, supporting the weekday-demand shifts claim. However, Chart 1's title ('Average Money by Coffee Name') implies average revenue by coffee type but lacks explicit reference to aggregation as average and scope clarity. The conclusion also highlights that 'milk and chocolate-based coffees like Latte and Hot Chocolate' have higher average revenue per sale than Espresso, which is a proportion comparison by coffee type. While Chart 1 implies a distribution or average per coffee, it could be improved by explicitly showing proportions or ranking by average revenue across coffee types to better support the claim about higher revenues for specific coffee types (milk and chocolate-based).",

          "revised_title": "Share of Average Revenue by Coffee Name",
          "explanation": "Since the key claim involves proportion/level of revenue by coffee types (milk and chocolate-based coffees having higher revenue), a pie chart showing the share of average revenue contribution by coffee types will directly support the conclusion about highest average revenue per sale by coffee type. This also complements Chart 2's clear trend over weekdays without redundancy."
