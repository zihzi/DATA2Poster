  "final_score": 85,
  "justification": "The conclusion is well supported by the chart titles and insights. The claim types predominantly involve proportions and distributions (e.g., sales dominance, share by retailer and sales method), which align well with titles emphasizing total sales distribution, sales method breakdown, and retailer comparisons. Variables and entities match closely with total sales measures by retailer, sales method, and product, with clear aggregation and consistent scope. The presence of subgroup specificity (e.g., by retailer, sales method, product, Walmart and West Gear segmentation) supports granularity claims like channel and gender/product differences. However, no chart explicitly mentions gender or detailed product category sales outside Walmart and West Gear, nor is there explicit evidence on niche/localized strength or promotional pricing beyond the outlet channel reference. Also, time-bound trend claims are absent, limiting coverage of dynamic aspects. These minor gaps prevent a perfect score but overall, the evidence strongly supports the conclusion."
