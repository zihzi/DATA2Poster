      "insight": "Across the studied period, the Action genre shows strong periods of increasing worldwide gross (e.g., 1998-2000, 2002, 2004-2005) but also notable declines (e.g., 1999, 2005-2007), indicating volatility in audience reception. Comedy and Drama also display intermittent upward trends, with Comedy showing growth spikes around 2004-2006 and Drama increasing notably in 2004-2006. Thriller exhibits generally decreasing gross in many intervals, except brief increases in 1997 and 2007-2008.",

These fluctuations suggest cyclical or market-driven influences on total gross revenues across years regardless of genre.",
